## Overview

Attest.ink provides a standardized, professional method for clearly identifying the origin of content across digital media. Our badges offer a simple, elegant solution for transparent content attribution in an era where distinguishing between human and AI-generated content is increasingly important.

## Features

- **Professional Badge System**: Clean, minimalist SVG badges that can be embedded in any digital content
- **Clear Visual Distinction**: Instantly recognizable icons and color schemes that differentiate human-crafted from AI-generated content
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Lightweight SVGs designed to work consistently across all platforms and environments
- **Elegant Typography**: Carefully selected fonts that maintain legibility at various sizes
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple implementation for content platforms, websites, documents, and media

## Quick Start

1. Include the badges in your content:

```html
<!-- For human-generated content -->
<img src="https://yourusername.github.io/attest.ink/assets/badges/human-generated.svg" alt="Human Generated" width="120" height="30">

<!-- For AI-generated content -->
<img src="https://yourusername.github.io/attest.ink/assets/badges/ai-generated.svg" alt="AI Generated" width="120" height="30">
```

2. Alternatively, use our simple JavaScript snippet for dynamic badge insertion:

```html
<script src="https://yourusername.github.io/attest.ink/js/attest.js"></script>
<script>
  // Add a human-generated badge to an element
  AttestInk.addBadge('human', '#my-human-content');
  
  // Add an AI-generated badge to an element
  AttestInk.addBadge('ai', '#my-ai-content');
</script>
```

## Badge Design Principles

Our badges follow these key design principles:

1. **Clarity**: Instantly recognizable at various sizes

4. **Simplicity**: Minimal design that doesn't distract from the content
5. **Accessibility**: High contrast and clear typography for all users

- **Transparency**: Users have the right to know how content was created
